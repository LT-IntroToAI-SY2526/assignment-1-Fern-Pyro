AI-Generated Problem Set

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Document your original AI prompt below
2. Copy the problems your AI assistant generated
3. Implement solutions for each problem
4. Include comments explaining your approach
5. Test your solutions with different inputs

MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
"I am a high school student with a background in java programming, but have no prior experience with python. Create a problem set of 5-7 questions that cover the basics of python a beginner needs to know. Assume knowledge of programming concepts, but not how concepts are applied to python."

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

PROBLEM 1: Conditionals
 Write a Python function grade_level(age) that returns:
    "Elementary" if age < 11,
    "Middle" if 11 <= age < 14,
    "High School" if 14 <= age < 18,
    "College" otherwise.

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
