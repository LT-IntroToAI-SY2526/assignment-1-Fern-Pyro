# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
  
      I was technically introduced to Python through a summer program when I was younger, but I would consider this to be more of my initial experience with Python. Compared to Java, Python definitely has less restrictive syntax, which allows you to condense chunks of code into one line.

3. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

    For one of the a1.py problems (sum_even_numbers function) I was unsure of how to approach the problem, so I prompted ChatGBT to explain the logic behind creating such a program without giving me the actual solution; I also gave it the description of what the function is supposed to do and an example of a desired output (specifying that the language being used was Python).

4. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

5. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
